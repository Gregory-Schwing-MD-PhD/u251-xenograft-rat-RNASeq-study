# Transcriptomic Evolution of U251 Glioblastoma Cells: From Culture to Orthotopic Growth and Post-therapy Recurrence

![Visual Abstract](ASSETS/Visual_abstract.png)

## Project Overview

This project addresses a critical gap in glioblastoma (GBM) modeling: the lack of longitudinal RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) datasets tracking tumor evolution through clinically relevant stages. Specifically, we investigate the transcriptomic shifts of U251 cells from **standard in vitro culture**, to **orthotopic growth** in the murine brain (Primary), and finally through **recurrence following Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)**.

While U251 is a widely used model, classic profiling shows that gene expression shifts substantially when implanted orthotopically, underscoring the dominance of the brain microenvironment. This project aims to quantify these adaptations and define the transcriptional consequences of focal thermal ablation.

## Experimental Design & Sample Cohorts

This dataset comprises four distinct biological groups representing the trajectory of tumor evolution and relevant controls.

### 1. In Vitro Culture (Baseline)

- **Sample IDs:** `C2B`
- **Description:** U251 human glioblastoma cells maintained in standard 2D adherent culture (log phase growth) prior to implantation.
- **Purpose:** Serves as the transcriptional baseline for the in vitro state.
- *Not included in the DESeq2 model — retained only as an out-of-experiment reference for exploratory PCA / clustering.*

### 2. Primary Orthotopic Xenograft (Pre-LITT)

- **Sample IDs (DE cohort):** `IL67B`, `IL68B`, `IL69B`
- **Note:** A fourth sequenced Primary tumor (`IL64B`) was excluded from the DE analysis for technical reasons; it is not present in `ANALYSIS/metadata_therapy.csv`.
- **Model:** Adult female immunodeficient **RNU/RNU rats**.
- **Implantation:** $5 \times 10^5$ U251 cells stereotactically injected into the **striatum** (Coordinates: 3.5 mm right of bregma, depth 3.0 mm).
- **Tumor Status:** Tumors were allowed to establish and grow for approximately 2 weeks (reaching ~4 mm diameter) as confirmed by MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging prior to intervention.
- **Purpose:** Captures the "brain-adapted" signature, highlighting upregulation of ECM, invasion, and vascular programs absent in plastic culture.

### 3. Recurrent Tumor (Post-LITT)

- **Sample IDs:** `IL66B`, `NL70B`, `NL71B`
- **Ablation Method:** Orthotopic tumors were treated with the **Visualase® clinical LITT system** (Medtronic) using a 980 nm diode laser fiber inserted stereotactically into the tumor center.
- **Parameters:** Ablation was performed under real-time MRI guidance (DWI) using rat-adapted settings (1 Volt, 30–40s duration) to achieve coagulative necrosis of the tumor bulk while creating a sublethal thermal penumbra in the peritumoral tissue.
- **Recurrence:** These samples represent the tumor regrowth harvested longitudinally after the thermal ablation procedure, representing the therapy-resistant subclone or stress-adapted state.

### 4. Control Samples

- **Sample IDs:** `N168B`, `N269B`
- **Description:** Non-tumor brain tissue or procedural controls.
- **Purpose:** Provides a negative control background for normalizing tumor-specific expression and identifying non-specific sequencing artifacts.

## Background & Scientific Context

### 1. In Vitro vs. Orthotopic Xenografts

Evidence suggests that the brain microenvironment exerts a dominant influence on transcriptional states.

- **Convergent Profiles:** Gene expression profiles of GBM lines (U251, U87) become more similar to each other—and to patient GBM—in orthotopic settings than in vitro.
- **Key Pathways:** Orthotopic tumors upregulate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis, whereas in vitro cultures favor classical proliferation genes.
- **Clinical Relevance:** Orthotopic xenografts cluster closely with patient GBM samples, recapitulating hypoxia and invasion signatures that subcutaneous models fail to capture.

**Key Reference:** *Influence of in vivo growth on human glioma cell line gene expression* (Camphausen et al., 2005) — [PNAS Full Text](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0502887102).

### 2. Therapy-Driven Evolution (LITT)

Therapies such as radiation and thermal ablation do not just reduce tumor bulk; they drive selection.

- **LITT Mechanism:** LITT utilizes a laser fiber to deliver thermal energy, creating a central zone of necrosis (>60°C) surrounded by a sublethal thermal penumbra (43–60°C). [Mohammadi & Schroeder, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24471476/)
- **Penumbra Effects:** Surviving cells in this penumbra experience heat stress, transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hypoxia, likely driving distinct transcriptional states and eventual recurrence. [Nagaraja et al., 2023](https://www.cureus.com/articles/135901-persistent-peri-ablation-blood-brain-barrier-opening-after-laser-interstitial-thermal-therapy-for-brain-tumors)
- **Model Validation:** The Nagaraja et al. model confirms that while LITT achieves near-complete ablation of the central mass, viable tumor cells persist in the periphery, serving as the seed for recurrence. [Nagaraja et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8893160/)

### 3. Primary vs. Recurrent GBM Signatures

Matched patient datasets provide a template for analyzing recurrence.

- **Recurrence Signatures:** Recurrent GBM consistently shows upregulation of mesenchymal/stromal programs, myelination, and immune interactions (e.g., Fcγ receptor, complement).
- **Downregulation:** Purely proliferative and cell-cycle pathways are often downregulated in recurrence compared to primary tumors.

## The Gap: Why This Dataset is Needed

Despite the establishment of LITT as a therapy and U251 as a model, current literature lacks a unified transcriptomic study that:

1. **Benchmarks** U251 culture-to-brain adaptation at RNAseq resolution.
2. **Profiles** the orthotopic tumor specifically after LITT focal ablation.
3. **Longitudinally samples** the recurrence to test for convergence on mesenchymal/stress-tolerant states.

This repository houses the analysis and data to address this unmet need.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Clone to First Run

This section walks the pipeline end-to-end on **Warrior HPC** (WSU), from a fresh clone through the first xengsort job. All commands assume Warrior's SLURM scheduler and a working `mambaforge` install.

### Prerequisites

- WSU Warrior HPC account with SLURM access
- `mambaforge` installed at `$HOME/mambaforge` with a `nextflow` env (see [Software Requirements](#-software-requirements--installation) below)
- Singularity/Apptainer available on compute nodes
- Google Drive OAuth bearer token saved to `~/.gdrive_token` in this format:

```bash
echo 'export GDRIVE_TOKEN="ya29.a0Af..."' > ~/.gdrive_token
chmod 600 ~/.gdrive_token
```

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url> u251-transcriptomic-evolution
cd u251-transcriptomic-evolution
```

### Step 2 — Download raw FASTQs from Google Drive

```bash
cd DATA/RNASEQ/RAW
sbatch download_slurm.sh
```

**What it does:** Sources `~/.gdrive_token`, auto-installs `gdown` if missing, then runs `download_files.sh` to pull the raw paired-end FASTQs into `DATA/RNASEQ/RAW/downloaded_files/`.

**Resources:** `-q primary`, 1 node, 16 GB, walltime 7d. **Monitor:** `output_<jobid>.out` / `errors_<jobid>.err`; final `checksum_results.log` once `parse_log.py` runs.

### Step 3 — Build reference bundle

```bash
cd ../../../ANALYSIS
sbatch create_refs_final.slurm
```

**What it does:** Runs `create_refs_final.sh` under `r/4.5.0` to populate `ANALYSIS/refs/`:

- `refs/human/` — GENCODE v44 GRCh38 primary assembly FASTA + GTF (MD5-verified)
- `refs/rat/` — Ensembl release 110 mRatBN7.2 toplevel FASTA + GTF (gzip-verified) — used by xengsort as the host reference to filter out rat reads (not analyzed downstream)
- `refs/pathways/human/` — MSigDB v2023.2 (Hallmark, C2, KEGG, GO:BP), DSigDB, BrainGMTv2 human orthologs, plus a deduplicated `combined_human.gmt`
- `refs/pathways/human/human_string/` — STRING v12.0 PPI network (taxon 9606): protein links + protein info

**Resources:** `-q primary`, 1 node, 1 CPU, 8 GB, walltime 1h.

### Step 4 — Run xengsort to remove host (rat) reads

From the repo root:

```bash
cd ..
sbatch submit_xengsort.sh
```

> **⚠️ Important:** `submit_xengsort.sh` as currently written invokes `nextflow run main.nf -profile singularity -resume` with no `--host_fasta` / `--graft_fasta` / `--input` arguments. `main.nf` hard-errors if those are missing. Edit the final line to:
>
> ```bash
> nextflow run main.nf -profile singularity \
> --input  "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/samplesheet.csv" \
> --host_fasta  "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/refs/rat/Rattus_norvegicus.mRatBN7.2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz" \
> --graft_fasta "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/refs/human/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz" \
> --outdir "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS" \
> -resume
> ```
>
> The `host` is rat (background to filter); the `graft` is the human tumor (signal to retain).

**What it does:**

1. `INDEX` — builds the xengsort *k*-mer index on the combined human+rat reference (`k=25`, `n=4.5e9`, `bucketsize=4`, `subtables=15`, `fill=0.85`) and caches it to `ANALYSIS/xengsort_index_clean/` via `storeDir` so it survives `-resume`.
2. `SORT_READS` — per sample, runs `xengsort classify` in `coverage` mode and merges output bins:
   - `*_human_R{1,2}.fq.gz` = `graft` + `both` (graft + conserved reads) — these are used downstream
   - `*_rat_R{1,2}.fq.gz` = `host` + `both` — produced but not analyzed in this version
   - `Ambiguous` reads are dropped (PCR-hybrid artifacts, per Zentgraf 2021).
3. `MULTIQC` — aggregates per-sample classification stats into `ANALYSIS/results_therapy/U251_Final_Report.html`.

**Resources:** Pre-pulls the `go2432/xengsort:latest` Singularity image into `$HOME/singularity_cache`, sets `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$HOME/xdr` to avoid `/run/user/` permission errors, clears stale `.nextflow/cache/LOCK` files, then launches. Per-process: `INDEX` requests 16 CPU / 80 GB; `SORT_READS` requests 8 CPU / 32 GB.

After Step 4 completes, the sorted human-stream FASTQs in `ANALYSIS/sorted_fastqs/` feed directly into Phase 2A below.

---

## Bioinformatics Workflow

Raw sequencing reads are first computationally sorted by xengsort to remove rat host reads, then the retained human (tumor) reads are aligned, quantified, and passed to DESeq2 for differential expression. The rat-mapping reads are produced by xengsort but are not analyzed in this version of the project.

### Phase 1: Host read removal with xengsort

**Tool:** [xengsort](https://gitlab.com/genomeinformatics/xengsort) (Zentgraf & Rahmann, 2021) wrapped in a local Nextflow DSL2 pipeline (`main.nf` + `submit_xengsort.sh`).

A critical challenge in orthotopic xenografts is the high sequence conservation between human tumor cells and the rat host brain. Earlier iterations of this project used BBSplit competitive alignment; the current pipeline uses **xengsort**, a *k*-mer-based xenograft sorter that is substantially faster than alignment-based tools and produces explicit `graft` / `host` / `both` / `ambiguous` / `neither` bins per read.

**Why xengsort over BBSplit:**

- *k*-mer hashing (no alignment) → 10–100× faster on equivalent hardware
- Explicit conserved-read bin (`both`) that we *fold back* into the human stream rather than discard, per Conway et al. 2012 and Zentgraf & Rahmann 2021
- Explicit ambiguous bin (`Ambiguous`) for likely PCR-chimera reads that we *exclude*

**Parameters (in `main.nf`):**

- `k=25` (paper optimum for human–mouse; validated for human–rat in this project)
- `n=4.5e9` slots, `bucketsize=4`, `subtables=15`, `fill=0.85`
- `--mode coverage` for classify (writes paired FASTQs per bin)

See [Step 4](#step-4--run-xengsort-to-remove-host-rat-reads) above for the full submit command.

### Phase 2: Human-stream alignment and quantification

**Tool:** `nf-core/rnaseq` (v3.22.2)

The sorted `*_human_R{1,2}.fq.gz` files from `ANALYSIS/sorted_fastqs/` are aligned against GRCh38 (GENCODE v44) with STAR and quantified with Salmon, producing `salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv` and `salmon.merged.gene_lengths.tsv`.

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq \
    -r 3.22.2 \
    -profile singularity \
    --input "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/samplesheet.csv" \
    --outdir "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/results_human_final" \
    --fasta "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/refs/human/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz" \
    --gtf "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/refs/human/GRCh38.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz" \
    --skip_bbsplit true \
    --max_cpus 16 \
    --max_memory '64.GB' \
    -resume
```

*Note: `samplesheet.csv` for this phase points to the xengsort-sorted human FASTQs, not the raw reads.*

### Phase 2A: Differential Expression Analysis (Human Reads)

**Tools:** `nf-core/differentialabundance` (v1.5.0), wrapping DESeq2.

#### Study design used for DE

Differential expression is run on **one contrast only**:

- **Therapy Impact** — `Recurrent_U2` (post-LITT, n = 3) vs. `Primary_U2` (pre-LITT, n = 3).

The DE cohort is exactly the 6 samples in `ANALYSIS/metadata_therapy.csv`:

| Sample | Classification | Environment |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| IL67B  | Primary_U2     | In_Vivo     |
| IL68B  | Primary_U2     | In_Vivo     |
| IL69B  | Primary_U2     | In_Vivo     |
| IL66B  | Recurrent_U2   | In_Vivo     |
| NL70B  | Recurrent_U2   | In_Vivo     |
| NL71B  | Recurrent_U2   | In_Vivo     |

The in vitro Culture sample (`C2B`) is **not in the DE model.** It is retained only as an out-of-experiment reference for exploratory PCA / clustering / distance analyses, never as input to a DESeq2 fit or Wald test. A fourth Primary tumor (`IL64B`) was sequenced but excluded from the DE cohort for technical reasons. The single contrast (`Recurrent_U2` vs. `Primary_U2`) is declared in `ANALYSIS/contrasts_therapy.csv`.

#### How to run it

From the repo root, on Warrior:

```bash
sbatch run_de_pdx_v3.sh
```

This submits the following under SLURM (8 CPU, 24 GB, 8 h walltime):

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/differentialabundance \
    -r 1.5.0 \
    -profile singularity \
    --input    "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/metadata_therapy.csv" \
    --contrasts "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/contrasts_therapy.csv" \
    --matrix   "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/results_human_final/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv" \
    --transcript_length_matrix "$(pwd)/ANALYSIS/results_human_final/star_salmon/salmon.merged.gene_lengths.tsv" \
    --shinyngs_build_app \
    -params-file therapy_v3_params.yaml \
    -resume
```

All DESeq2 / GSEA behavior is controlled by `therapy_v3_params.yaml`.

#### What DESeq2 does inside the pipeline call

1. **Count import.** `salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv` and `salmon.merged.gene_lengths.tsv` are read in via **tximport**, which supplies DESeq2 with per-gene effective-length offsets so that normalization correctly accounts for between-sample differences in average transcript length.
2. **Pre-filtering.** Genes with total counts below `filtering_min_abundance: 10` across the 6 DE samples are dropped before model fitting.
3. **DESeqDataSet construction.** Because `differential_subset_to_contrast_samples: true` is set, a fresh `DESeqDataSet` is built using only the samples in the contrast — here, all 6 (3 `Primary_U2` + 3 `Recurrent_U2`) — with `design = ~ Classification`.
4. **Model fit.** `DESeq()` runs three steps in sequence:
   - `estimateSizeFactors()` — median-of-ratios library-size normalization.
   - `estimateDispersions()` — gene-wise dispersions shrunk toward a parametric mean–dispersion trend by empirical Bayes.
   - `nbinomWaldTest()` — Wald test on the `Recurrent_U2 vs Primary_U2` coefficient.
5. **Results table.** `results()` produces per-gene log2 fold change, standard error, Wald statistic, raw p-value, and Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted p-value. The full table (one row per filtered gene) is written to `ANALYSIS/results_therapy_v3/tables/differential/`.
6. **Variance-stabilized counts.** `deseq2_vs_method: "rlog"` is applied to the count matrix and used for PCA, sample-to-sample heatmaps, and as the Euclidean distance input to **PERMANOVA** (`vegan::adonis2`, 999 permutations) in `create_publication_figure_600_dpi.R`.

#### Small-sample-size handling (n = 3 vs. n = 3)

The following `therapy_v3_params.yaml` settings are explicitly chosen to keep the analysis well-behaved at this sample size:

| Parameter                                  | Value               | Purpose                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deseq2_min_replicates_for_replace`        | `99`                | Disables DESeq2's Cook's-distance outlier replacement, which requires ≥7 replicates per group to be reliable.                     |
| `deseq2_vs_method`                         | `"rlog"`            | rlog shrinks low-count noise more aggressively than VST and is preferred over VST at small N for downstream PCA / clustering.      |
| `differential_subset_to_contrast_samples`  | `true`              | DESeqDataSet is fit only on samples in the contrast; prevents non-contrast samples from influencing dispersion estimation.         |
| `filtering_min_abundance`                  | `10`                | Drops low-count genes before fitting to stabilize dispersion estimation and reduce the BH multiple-testing burden.                 |
| `gsea_permute`                             | `"gene_set"`        | Phenotype permutation is unreliable at N < 7 per group; gene-set permutation is used instead.                                      |
| `gsea_metric`                              | `"Diff_of_Classes"` | A robust gene-ranking metric at small N; Signal2Noise can crash or be unstable when group N is very small.                         |
| `gsea_set_min` / `gsea_set_max`            | `15` / `500`        | Standard MSigDB-style bounds; excludes degenerate small or over-broad gene sets.                                                   |
| `gsea_rnd_seed`                            | `1234`              | Fixed seed for reproducibility of the GSEA permutation null.                                                                       |

What is **not** done in the *primary* DE call: no batch-correction term is added (the design is `~ Classification`, not `~ batch + Classification`), no surrogate-variable correction, and no manual outlier exclusion beyond the prior removal of `IL64B`. The intent is that the single biological covariate (`Classification`) is the only modeled effect, and that small-N robustness is handled by the parameter choices above plus the threshold sweep below. Separately, a **RUVSeq contamination-adjustment sensitivity analysis** ([Phase 2B](#phase-2b-contamination-adjustment-sensitivity-analysis-ruvseq)) re-runs this same contrast with factors of unwanted variation added as covariates, to test whether the findings survive correction for residual cross-species contamination.

#### DE-gene calling: threshold sweep (not a single cutoff)

The pipeline writes the full per-gene results table; significance is then evaluated at **multiple |log2FC| thresholds** rather than committing to one a priori. All thresholds are evaluated at **padj < 0.05** (Benjamini–Hochberg).

| Threshold (\|log2FC\|) | Equivalent linear fold change | Notes                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| > 0.585               | > 1.5-fold                    | Matches `differential_min_fold_change: 1.5` in the params file. |
| > 1.0                 | > 2-fold                      | Conventional "biologically meaningful" cutoff.                  |
| > 1.5                 | ≈ > 2.83-fold                 | Stricter; reduces low-effect-size noise at small N.             |
| > 2.0                 | > 4-fold                      | Most stringent; tests whether the top-hit signature persists.   |

The threshold sweep is applied post-hoc in `create_publication_figure_600_dpi.R` against the full DESeq2 results table. The intent is to characterize **signature robustness** — i.e., which genes / pathways remain enriched as the effect-size requirement tightens — rather than to report a single cherry-picked cutoff. Pathway enrichment (GSEA, gProfiler2 ORA) is rerun against each significant set so that downstream interpretation (drug prioritization, PPI hubs) can also be evaluated for threshold sensitivity.

### Phase 2B: Contamination-adjustment sensitivity analysis (RUVSeq)

**Tools:** `RUVSeq::RUVs` + DESeq2, driven by `run_ruvseq.sh`; metadata derived by `ANALYSIS/build_metadata_from_xengsort.py`.

**Status:** Standalone sensitivity analysis — **not** part of the automated `main.nf` / nf-core call. You launch it after Phase 1 (xengsort) and Phase 2 (Salmon) have produced their outputs.

#### Why this step exists

xengsort is the best available cross-species read sorter, but it cannot fully remove rat reads whose sequence is highly conserved with their human ortholog (ribosomal proteins, translation factors, histones, tubulins). Those reads are misclassified as `graft` and then misaligned by Salmon onto the human ortholog, producing a per-gene, sample-dependent contamination signal that scales with rat tissue fraction. Because Recurrent tumors carry a **lower graft fraction** than Primary tumors, this contamination differs systematically between the two groups in the DE contrast — which can manufacture artifactual differential expression in conserved gene families. (The "translation/ribosome downregulation in recurrence" signal is the highest-risk finding; the HIF/iron drug-prioritization axis is low-risk, because those genes are not unusually conserved.)

#### How it corrects for it

The three in-vivo samples with negligible graft fraction — the two procedural controls (`N168B`, `N269B`) plus the failed-graft `IL64B` (~0.3% graft, i.e. effectively rat brain) — passed through the identical library prep, sequencing, xengsort, and Salmon pipeline. Any human-gene signal they carry is, by construction, contamination. `RUVSeq::RUVs` estimates factors of unwanted variation **W** from these control replicates; **W** is then added as covariate(s) to the DESeq2 model. The controls anchor **W** but are excluded from the Primary-vs-Recurrent contrast itself.

| Sample | Role                   | graft % | host % |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| IL64B  | Control (failed graft) | 0.33    | 93.59  |
| N168B  | Control (procedural)   | 0.55    | 93.57  |
| N269B  | Control (procedural)   | 4.90    | 86.95  |

#### How to run it

From the repo root, on Warrior:

```bash
sbatch run_ruvseq.sh
```

Under SLURM (4 CPU, 32 GB, 1 h walltime) this:

1. **Derives metadata.** `ANALYSIS/build_metadata_from_xengsort.py` parses the `## Classification Statistics` block of each `ANALYSIS/xengsort_out/<sample>.txt`, computes `graft` / `host` / `both` percentages as `count / total`, and appends them to `ANALYSIS/metadata_base.csv` → `ANALYSIS/metadata_full.csv`. The fractions are **never hand-entered**; `metadata_full.csv` is a build artifact regenerated on every run (and is git-ignored).
2. **Estimates W and re-runs DE.** `ANALYSIS/ruvseq_contamination_adjustment.R` pre-filters genes (count ≥ 10 in ≥ 3 samples), runs `RUVs` at k = 1, 2, 3, and fits DESeq2 with `design = ~ W_1 + … + W_k + Classification` on the 6 Primary/Recurrent samples, alongside an unadjusted baseline (`~ Classification`).
3. **Diagnostics + k selection.** Concordance vs baseline (Spearman of log2FC, Jaccard of significant gene sets at padj < 0.05 & \|log2FC\| > 1, top-20 overlap), PCA before/after adjustment, and a Primary-vs-Recurrent silhouette per setting. The recommended k maximizes that silhouette. **Caveat:** a single 3-replicate control group spans at most ~2 effective factors, so k = 3 is near-degenerate and the silhouette heuristic is noisy at n = 3/group — k = 2 is the conventional default if the automatic pick is k = 1 or k = 3.

#### Outputs

Written to `ANALYSIS/results_ruvseq/` (see its [README](ANALYSIS/results_ruvseq/README.md)): adjusted DE tables per k, baseline DE, estimated W factors, concordance summary CSV, before/after PCA PDF, and `ruvseq_recommended_k.txt`. To adopt the adjustment as the primary result, point `create_publication_figure_600_dpi.R` at `ruvseq_adjusted_de_k{recommended}.tsv` instead of the baseline DESeq2 table.

- **[Singularity/Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (>=v3.6):** Executes the bioinformatics tools (xengsort, STAR, Salmon) within isolated containers to ensure version consistency across cluster nodes.
- **[xengsort](https://gitlab.com/genomeinformatics/xengsort) (Docker: `go2432/xengsort:latest`):** *k*-mer-based xenograft read sorter.
- **[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/):** A fast implementation of Conda used to manage the Nextflow installation and environment.
- **[Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/):** The software channel providing the bioinformatics-specific packages.

### Setup and Installation
